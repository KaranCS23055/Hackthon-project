The login form should present a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface with an emphasis on clarity, accessibility, and security. At the top of the form, include a welcoming title such as "Welcome Back" to greet returning users in a professional yet approachable tone. The form will consist of two primary input fields: one for the email address, and one for the password. The email field should be labeled clearly as "Email" with a placeholder example like "you@example.com
". The password field should be labeled as "Password" with a placeholder prompting users to "Enter your password". Both fields must include real-time validation with contextual error messages — for example, “Please enter your email address” if the field is left empty, or “Enter a valid email (e.g., name@domain.com
)” if the format is incorrect. Similarly, the password field should validate for presence and complexity, such as requiring at least 8 characters.
